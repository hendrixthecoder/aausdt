        <p class="font-semibold">Transparency and reliability</p>

        <p class="mt-20">
            The Tether company claims to have a 1:1 ratio of USD reserves to ensure that 1 USDT token always has the value of 1 USD. Users can check the reserves on the company's website to ensure the transparency of the monetary mechanism.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-semibold">Capital Protection: US Dollar Pegged</p>

        <p class="mt-20">The value of USDT is pegged to the US dollar. For each USDT issued and circulated, the equivalent US dollar is kept as a reserve on Tether at a ratio of 1 to 1, showing greater stability relative to other cryptocurrencies in this volatile market. Therefore, it becomes an excellent choice to protect your assets.</p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-semibold">Get a more intuitive understanding of the value of each currency</p>

        <p class="mt-20">When transacting between cryptocurrencies, it is difficult to directly know the value of each currency. By the way, considering that 1 USDT is equal to 1 USD, it is easier to check the value of each digital currency with USDT transactions.</p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-semibold">Fast Cycle</p>

        <p class="mt-20 ">The circulation of USDT is based on the blockchain, which is stable and safe, and the circulation speed is fast.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mt-20">What is USDT</p>
        <p class="mt-5">USDT is the acronym for USDT Tether, a token created by the Tether company with a very simple idea of having a stable digital token pegged to the US dollar (USD), ie 1 USDT is equivalent to 1 USD. The issuance and trading of USDT is based on the Omni protocol (the original Mastercoin protocol) and runs on Blockchain 2.0.</p>
